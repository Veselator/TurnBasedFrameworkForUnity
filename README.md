Hi there!
This is a repository of the Turn-Based Framework. It was created to simplify development of turn-based game flow by providing ready-to-use tools.

## Key features
- async states of gameflow: before game starts, after end of turn, after end of round, etc.;
- unified global states using pattern Event bus;
- rules system that makes system scalable and expandable, possible to add various types of rule: rule for win or defeat, for calculating points, to check conditions during turn, after round etc.;
- clean architecture with documentation.
